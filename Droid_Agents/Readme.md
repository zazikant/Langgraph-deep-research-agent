1. Place the "Deep Research Agent.yaml" file in path like so: /home/zazikant/.factory/droids/deep-research-agent.yaml
2. cd to a folder if you want the agent to look for files having some base research or output already
3. Run bash command droid @deep-research-agent "Research figma mcp" it will do thorough research mimmicking the python code base that i gave a reference.

This yaml file is not a direct agent but the bash comamnd allows the agentic behaviour to follow  prompt to complete task.

Very important: when you run that agent, in bottom right of Droid agent  the yaml file is used as you have reference @deep-research-agent    deep-research-agent.yaml • | MCP ✓
