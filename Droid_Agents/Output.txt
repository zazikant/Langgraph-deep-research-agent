⛬  Figma MCP Research Summary

   Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables AI coding assistants to access structured Figma design data for accurate code generation. There are two main implementations:

   1. **Official Figma MCP Server** (by Figma)
   •  Released: Beta in June 2025
   •  Requirements: Figma Professional/Enterprise plan, Figma desktop app
   •  Setup: Local (via desktop app) or remote (hosted endpoint)
   •  Features:
     •  Generate code from Figma frames
     •  Extract design context (variables, components, layout data)
     •  Access FigJam and Make file resources
     •  Code Connect integration for design system consistency
   •  Supported Editors: VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code
   •  Documentation: https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/

   2. **Figma-Context-MCP** (Community/GLips)
   •  Repository: https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP
   •  Type: Open-source, standalone alternative
   •  Requirements: Figma access token (works with free plans)
   •  Setup: npx figma-developer-mcp --figma-api-key=<your-key>
   •  Features:
     •  Simplified Figma API responses
     •  Provides only relevant layout/styling info
     •  Quick integration without desktop app
     •  Customizable and lightweight

   Key Benefits:
   •  60-80% faster design-to-code iterations vs screenshots
   •  Design fidelity: Accurate implementation from structured metadata
   •  Real-time context: AI accesses up-to-date design information
   •  Universal protocol: Works across multiple AI coding tools

   Typical Workflow:
   1. Paste Figma file/frame link in your IDE
   2. Ask AI assistant to implement the design
   3. AI fetches structured design data via MCP
   4. Generates accurate code matching design specs

   The official server offers tighter integration but requires paid plans, while the community version provides a more accessible entry point for all users.
